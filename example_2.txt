In this paper we consider the question of smoothness of slowly varying functions satisfying the modern definition that, in the last two decades, gained prevalence in the applications concerning function spaces and interpolation. We show, that every slowly varying function of this type is equivalent to a slowly varying function that has continuous classical derivatives of all orders.
